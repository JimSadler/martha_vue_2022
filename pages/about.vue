              Martha Novak has a unique roadmap which takes you from awareness
              to consciousness to the enlightened life that is yours for the
              choosing. It is unlike any healing journey you have ever
              experienced. By releasing you once and for all from habitual
              emotional clutter and circular thinking, you are freed from the
              hold of the past to move fully into your dynamic present. Here you
              find deep levels of peace, compassion and forgiveness for yourself
              and others. Here you begin to live the powerful and
              ever-expanding, abundant life that is yours in the fullness of
              God.
            </p>
            <p class="container-paragraphs">
              It is here in the fullness of God, where you live your life in
              complete authenticity. In advanced stages of consciousness, you
              experience the enlightened life, free from anxiety and fear.
              Instead, your life is filled with ever increasing joy, passion and
              potential. You live your truth, you know that you are limited by
              nothing, you know that you are pure, creative potential as your
              mind is sharply focused to create the life you want.
            </p>
            <p class="container-paragraphs">
              If this sounds too good to be true, you do not know Martha. She is
              a powerful spiritual teacher, healer, and emotional intuitive who,
              over her lifetime, has developed a life-changing system of
              training, not only for business, but also for spirituality in
              every aspect of daily life. It is called The Burgess Process and
              it teaches that everything is the spiritual journey.

            <p class="bio-txt">
              All my life Iâ€™ve been searching for answers, even as a child.
              Somewhere inside of me, I knew life had more love, joy, happiness,
              peace, and fulfillment in store for me than I have ever allowed.
              <br />While I had accomplished things in life, nothing was ever
              enough. I read books, meditated, investigated different religions
              but nothing filled my emptiness. At age 56, my life as I had known
              it changed. My 35 year marriage and business partnership was over.
              In the chaos of this, I was miraculously led to Martha Novak who
              presented me with the questions I needed to be asking and the new
              answers I needed to become considering. <br />I have been studying
              with her now for almost ten years. She does not train her people
              lightly and I have studied hard. Two years ago, I was privileged
              to become one of her master healers and facilitators. <br />I now
              use my experience in retail, entrepreneurship, and personal
              relationships to help others on their journey.

              Betty Smith Sadler is a Certified Master Facilitator in Infinite
              Insight. She grew up with a strong sensitivity to people, animals,
              and the natural world that has deepened and evolved through the
              years. She received an MEd in Rehabilitation Counseling and worked
              in this field for many years. Her love of art led her to explore
              and develop her considerable creative abilities and she earned a
              BFA in drawing and painting. She has always been driven by a deep
              spiritual connection that has taken her far below the surface of
              appearances. Her spiritual development reached its deepest level
              when she starting working with Martha Novak and Infinite Insight.
              Through her years of work with Martha, Betty's natural empathetic
              abilities have been refined and sophisticated making her an adept
              at guiding her clients to clarity, peace, joy, and potential.
              Betty now assists clients in realizing that God is a God of more
              and is right there inside each of them ready to be used and
              enjoyed.

              Tracy works with Martha Novak and Infinite Insight in Sandy
              Springs, Georgia. Tracy was born and reared in Atlanta, Ga. and
              worked in marketing and advertising for 30 years. Tracy has always
              been interested in consciousness studies as an avid reader and
              researcher, but true clarity was not found until she attended a
              Leadership Program at AT&T where Martha Novak spoke. Tracy
              recognized Martha immediately as her teacher and started weekly
              sessions with her as well as participating in years of study in
              healing and spiritual development classes. Tracy now works full
              time as an intuitive and healing facilitator with Martha and works
              daily to be a clear channel for herself and her clients. With the
              tools Tracy has to share with you, all things are possible.
