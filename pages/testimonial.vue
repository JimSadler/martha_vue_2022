              Martha Novak is simply the best. I knew the moment I saw her that
              she was the one to lead me on the journey. She safely takes you to
              the deepest understandings of yourself and your world, far beyond
              anything you ever could have imagined. And from there, you begin
              the life you want. It's inevitable in her presence and you will
              never look back. Ever. Simply the best.

              Martha is a trustworthy and fearless guide for me on my journey to
              consciousness, with unwavering dedication to truth and lasting,
              positive change. Martha lives the simple, yet profound, message
              conveyed through her work. She has an extraordinary ability to
              bring ascended information and energy through to be integrated and
              experienced in the lives of others. She inspires me with her
              generosity of spirit and her vision. Thank you, Martha, for being
              an amazing blessing in my life, and a true friend.

              Martha is a brilliant teacher and this is the bottom line of every
              aspect of her work. She ignites a fire to learn about yourself,
              about the world and how to live in the fullest, most joyful, most
              productive and satisfying of ways. Even after nearly 8 years of
              working with Martha, I never cease to be amazed at her ability to
              inspire, and at her honesty and compassion; lessons are always
              growing deeper, never stagnant. She translates the language of
              universal truths into a usable language of the day-to-day and
              whether she is addressing one person or huge crowds, she has the
              ability to make everyone feel she is addressing only him or her.
              Working and learning with Martha has been exhilarating and the
              smartest and safest thing I've ever done. It changes life forever.

              A mutual friend said to me with admiration, “Martha Novak is a
              force of nature!” I smiled with recognition of a fellow Martha fan
              and quickly agreed wholeheartedly. Martha is indeed a treasure who
              manages to exemplify the delicate balance of living life as a
              conscious human. She is sharp, and bright, and articulate while
              being simultaneously warm, compassionate and unbelievably
              charming. She challenges you, guides you, educates you and
              applauds your inevitable transformation under her care. When you
              are ready, when it is time for you to live the life you really
              want to live, then you will find her, or one of her many master
              graduate students, and your life will simply never be the same.
              Her Infinite Insight is complete, brilliant, and unique. And the
              results, well, for me they were nothing short of miraculous. My
              undying gratitude to, and for, this beautiful, authentic woman!

              My wife has been into consciousness raising for years. I've
              accompanied her to this and that, and so I thought I was going
              along for another nice ride when she found Martha Burgess Novak
              and The Burgess Process. Right away, Martha and her work spoke to
              me as a man, as a husband, and as a father. I was truly blown
              away. Since that time, I have joined Martha in her classes, in her
              lectures, and in her private sessions. Her insight is amazing and
              she really does teach you how to live in joy, love, peace and
              harmony with ourselves, other people and our God. Martha doesn't
              just tell you "it's out there" for you. She gives you the
              practical, step by step approaches to get there, encouraging you
              fully along the way. I'd recommend her and this work to every man
              out there. Instead of waiting for your wives to initiate... this
              time, take your wives!

              In an attempt to uncover the deep-seated issues that I knew were
              lurking in my subconscious I spent a lifetime searching with
              counselors, healers, alternative medicine, self-help workshops,
              you name it! Having come up empty-handed time and again, I
              despaired that I would ever find the answers I needed and I just
              gave up. Enter Martha Burgess Novak! How can I begin to describe
              someone who has changed my life on the deepest levels? Having
              worked with Martha for several months I have been transformed to
              my very core. She truly has a direct channel to the Divine, which
              is, undeniably, the source of her power. Using her incisive,
              intuitive abilities she cuts straight through to the heart of the
              issues at hand, clearing the way for deep, transformative healing
              on all levels. Not only does she guide you through the process of
              illuminating the truth of your issues but she also uses her
              all-reaching healing powers to insure that you have cleared that
              problem forever from your psyche. Her energy, love and light are
              totally empowering: she is Love personified! Should you be looking
              for proof…the unquestionable proof is that at age 71 I am the
              happiest I have ever been in my entire life! Through the profound
              changes I have experienced while working with Martha, the weight
              of the world has been lifted from my shoulders and my inner child
              is emerging! So if you are considering working with her my advice
              is RUN don’t walk…your true Self is waiting for you!

              I’ve been searching for God in my day to day life for most of my
              life. None of the teachers, books, or programs that I have
              explored over the years have come close to helping me know that
              connection in the way that Martha Novak and her Novak Process
              does. Through her private sessions, lectures, CDs and group
              classes, I am finding my way to my own relationship with God.
              Martha facilitates with love, humor and great, good natured joy,
              teaching us how to come from Love, the God in each of us, in every
              relationship. What began as a personal quest has expanded into
              more deeply loving, happier relationships with my husband, our
              children, friends, and even the passing stranger. Our whole family
              works with the Novak Process and has been transformed by it. Even
              those not directly working with Martha and her work respond to the
              changes in us and relationships change for the better. I can’t
              recommend Martha and this work highly enough!

              Martha was giving a leadership training course for AT&amp;T when I
              first met her. By the end of the day my back hurt so badly, I was
              lying on the floor. Martha looked down at me and asked me what I
              was doing. I told her I had chronic back problems. She said, "Come
              see me and I'll help you with that." Now I had sought help for my
              back from professionals for many years and nothing helped
              permanently. But I called the very next day. After working with
              Martha for a few short weeks, I was free of back pain and have
              stayed free of it for years now. I began taking her classes and
              was lucky enough to do weekly sessions and, shortly thereafter, I
              left AT&amp;T for a new career as a facilitator in her company.
              Martha Burgess Novak and The Burgess Process are life changers.
              They were for me and they will be for you.
